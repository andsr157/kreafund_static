Why Burma…Why now? 

It's the WINTER of 2023, and it certainly is NOT a good time to be hanging out in
 Burma. My name is 
Charlie Costello, and after six years, I am finally close to completing the book,
 Hanging Out in Burma: Laundry Lines and Democracy Hanging in the Balance.
Just before my first visit in December 2011, the military began loosening its grip 
on the country. But when I 
arrived it still felt as if Big Brother was watching, that the authoritarian 
regime's
 oppressive rule still 
prevailed. 

This incredible country, the people and their cultural traditions and wisdom, 
the colors, the biodiversity, 
a country with so much to save - was calling out to me to Hang Out in Burma.Your
 support will help me complete the book and shine a light on BURMA amidst all of
  the things happening in 
the world.

Burma is a country rich in mind, body, and soul, but sadly, a land that has been 
held hostage by its 
own military government.  I want this project to tell my story, as I walk you 
through photos compiled over 
three trips, that will shine a light on the beauty, heart, and soul of the
country and its people.

Your support will pay homage to the strength and beauty of the people and
their country and their quest for
freedom that continues to this day.

In November 2015, a national election was held and the National League 
for Democracy (NLD) won in a landslide.  
Later the following year, the winning party had a chance to appoint the 
president and key members of the 
government.  I wasn't sure if it was real, so I traveled to Burma in 
February of 2016 to see for myself,
with my feet on the ground, whether or not this election was for real. 
 It seemed real. . .

Fast forward five tumultuous years when another national election was
held, and the NLD again, 
won in a landslide. 
Combine that with a world-wide pandemic and you have the unthinkable
scenario. But the unthinkable 
happened, when, 
on February 1, 2021, a military coup d'etat was carried out under 
the premise of vote irregularity.  
More than two 
years have passed since that brutal military coup occurred and 
it's time to shine a light on the beauty,
biodiversity, and people of this country.

This photograph was taken in February of 2014 in a village outside 
of Kalaw in the Shan State, after a 
festival when young boys become monks. As I walked through a neighboring
 village, I was struck by boys playing 
with guns, and the ease with which even a very young child carried what
 appeared to be a real gun judging by its
weight, as if it were an extension of his arm. The future is unknown in
 Burma and around the world, and the hope
  is for a more mindful awareness of the despair and needless suffering,
   where compassion, gratitude and loving
  kindness rule the lands.

This photo is also shown on page 108 of the book, the parting shot (pun
intended) and the last page of the 
book for a reason. 108 is considered sacred in Hinduism, Buddhism, and 
Yogic traditions. Malas or Japa beads 
come in a string of 108 and are used for devotional meditation, mantra,
 on a baseball.
Why Kickstarter?
<img src="img/p2.jpg" class="img-thumbnail rounded-0 border-0" alt="">

Short Answer: Because of the partnership with Blurb I chose to work 
with Kickstarter in order to raise money to 
self-publish this book.  Self-publishing is not for everyone, but it
 gives authors, writers, and photographers a 
chance to get their work out into the world.  

Longer Answer: Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing fundraising platform,
 meaning that if you don't reach the 
initial 
fundraising goal by the end of your campaign, then the project does not 
get funded. I am not sure I would 
meet the
requirements to get enough pre-orders in order to print the three 
versions in bulk, so I will be doing the 
fulfillment myself once the book is finalized. It also gives me a chance
 to bring awareness in support of the 
movement for democracy.
About me

I am a writer, photographer, and regenerative farmer, with a strong
 interest in community building and 
re-invigorating the concepts of local and global villages.  I spent
most of my life in the San Francisco 
Bay Area and recently relocated to a small community in the MidCoast
of Maine. 

I have lived and worked in Japan and Thailand and have traveled
 extensively throughout Southeast Asia. 
Hanging out in Burma: Laundry Lines and Democracy Hanging in the 
Balance is the culmination of three journeys 
to Burma which progressively deepened my appreciation of the beauty 
and warmth of its people and the plight 
of its democracy. My photographs have been exhibited at the Berkeley
 Art Center, the David Brower Center, 
and the Tides Foundation. I have a BA in English from Santa Clara 
University and an MA in Asian Studies 
from the University of San Francisco.

Hanging Out in Burma: Laundry Lines and Democracy Hanging in the 
Balance, is a personal project that I 
have been working on for the past six years.  Things just kept on 
changing in Burma after the 2015 election 
and as a result, the book project kept getting stalled. It's time 
to shine the light on Burma, on the people, 
the colors, the beauty, and a country with so much to save.
Gratitudes

Special thanks to Peter Coates, an artist, and painter from Great 
Britain, who suggested the title after he 
and his wife Gill welcomed me to share a boat ride up the Kaladan 
river to the ancient kingdom of Mrauk-U.  
I'd also like to thank the following individuals for their ongoing 
support of my travel to and writing about 
Burma. Firstly, Arlene Blum for introducing me to the beauty of the 
people, the colors, and the diversity of 
Burma, leading my first trip and trek into Inle Lake and beyond. 

I have a number of very special friends in Burma and I want to thank 
them all for their support, friendship, 
and insights. I'd also like to thank my academic supporters and 
friends, especially Professor Uldis Kruze for 
his ongoing friendship, support and work on behalf of Asia. Professor
 Judith White, for her work on behalf of 
many causes in Burma including support of my work along the way. 
Professor John Nelson, for his continued 
encouragement and support of my writing and photography. University 
of San Francisco's Center for the Pacific 
Rim's founding Director Barbara Bundy and the late Professor Patrick 
Hatcher supported me while studying in the 
program. Professor Chiho Sawada of Holy Names University for his 
support and friendship on behalf of my work and 
photography. Lastly, I'd like to thank my wife, Liz Cunningham for 
her unending support of my writing, photography 
and travels to Burma.x

    Risks and challenges
  </h2>
<p  class="main-text">

  Quite unsurprisingly, the most foreseeable issue we may struggle with is the release date.
  While we optimistically set it to December 2024, we know from experience that a lot can go
   wrong overnight when you develop a video game. This media involves so many fields that it's 
   hard to tell which one will cause trouble next!
  
  Additionally, we did not have a chance to delve too profoundly into the different console 
  ports yet. Of course we shall do our best to release the game on as many systems and platforms
   as possible, but be wary that Liam_99 may not make it onto your favorite console!

  Long-lasting design
  
  All-in-one goal of the crowdfunding and core reward for the backers, the game should be playable for years. It's especially true as we propose the game DRM-free, which means PC players don't have to launch the game through platforms such as Steam or Epic Games.
  
  Regarding physical rewards:
  
  - We'll work with a local print shop to bring the paper posters to life. This shall allow us to check quality and minimize environmental costs linked to transport.
  
  - The T-shirts will be produced by a French company. We know from our own experience that they work with lasting materials.
  
  - The metallic posters will be handled by Displate. It's super sturdy, looks super cool, and the society works with communities in Africa to plant trees and improve the locals' quality of life.
